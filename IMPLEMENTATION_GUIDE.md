## CRUD Operations Fix

### ✅ All Requirements Completed

This implementation successfully fixes all 5 issues mentioned in the original problem statement:

1. ✅ **η διαγραφη μαθητη δεν λειτουργει** (Student deletion not working)
2. ✅ **η διαγραφη μαθηματων δεν λειτουργει** (Lesson deletion not working)
3. ✅ **η επεξεργασια μαθηματων δεν λειτουργει** (Lesson editing not working)
4. ✅ **η επεξεργασια πληρωμης δεν λειτουργει** (Payment editing not working)
5. ✅ **η επαναληψη μαθηματων δεν λειτουργει** (Recurring lessons not working)

### Root Cause Analysis

The primary issue was **Row Level Security (RLS) policies** in Supabase:
- The original policies were too generic (`Enable all for authenticated users`)
- They didn't properly handle different operation types
- CASCADE deletes weren't working correctly with RLS enabled

### Solution

1. **Split RLS policies by operation type**:
   - Separate policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
   - Each policy explicitly allows authenticated users

2. **Fixed CASCADE constraints**:
   - Dropped and recreated foreign key constraints
   - Added ON DELETE CASCADE and ON UPDATE CASCADE
   - Ensures related records are automatically deleted

3. **Added missing UI functionality**:
   - Created AddEditRecurringLessonScreen for full CRUD
   - Updated RecurringLessonsScreen with add/edit buttons
   - All screens now properly call backend functions

### Backend Functions

All necessary backend functions are implemented in `supabaseService.js`:
- `deleteStudent(studentId)` ✓
- `deleteLesson(lessonId)` ✓
- `updateLesson(lessonId, lessonData)` ✓
- `updateLessonPayment(lessonId, newStatus)` ✓
- `addRecurringLesson(recurringData)` ✓
- `updateRecurringLesson(recurringId, recurringData)` ✓
- `deleteRecurringLesson(recurringId)` ✓

## New Features

### 1. Recurring Lessons

#### Creating Recurring Lessons

When adding a new lesson, you can now mark it as recurring:

1. Navigate to "Add Lesson" screen
2. Fill in all lesson details (student, date, time, duration, price)
3. Enable the "Επαναλαμβανόμενο μάθημα (κάθε εβδομάδα)" switch
4. Save the lesson

**What happens:**
- The lesson is created for the specified date
- A recurring lesson rule is automatically created
- Future lessons will be generated based on this rule (same day of week, same time)

**Note:** The recurring checkbox only appears when creating new lessons, not when editing existing ones.

### 2. Student Management

#### Delete Student

You can now delete students directly from the edit student screen:

1. Navigate to a student's edit page
2. Scroll to the bottom
3. Tap the red "Διαγραφή Μαθητή" button
4. Confirm the deletion

**Warning:** Deleting a student will also delete all their lessons and progress records due to database cascade deletion.

### 3. Payment Statistics

#### Month Navigation

The payment statistics screen now supports navigating between months:

1. Select "Μήνας" (Month) view
2. Use "← Προηγούμενος" to go to previous month
3. Use "Επόμενος →" to go to next month (disabled for future months)

The statistics will update to show data for the selected month.

#### Lessons Table

Below the statistics, you'll find a comprehensive table showing:
- All lessons for the selected period
- Student name
- Date and time
- Amount
- Payment status badge

**Edit Payment Status:**
- Tap the "✎" button next to any lesson
- Select new payment status:
  - Εκκρεμεί (Pending)
  - Πληρώθηκε (Paid)
  - Ακυρώθηκε (Cancelled)

### 4. Dark Mode

#### Enabling Dark Mode

Dark mode can be toggled from:
1. **Home Screen:** Tap the 🌙/☀️ icon in the header
2. **Settings Screen:** Use the "Σκούρο Θέμα" switch

The preference is saved and persists across app restarts.

**Features:**
- Complete theme support across all screens
- Calendar theme adapts to dark mode
- Persistent preference storage using AsyncStorage

### 5. Push Notifications

#### Setup Notifications

1. Navigate to Settings (⚙️ icon on home screen)
2. Enable "Ειδοποιήσεις Push"
3. Grant notification permissions when prompted

**Notification Types:**

1. **Upcoming Lesson Reminders**
   - Sent 60 minutes before each lesson
   - Shows student name and lesson time
   
2. **Payment Reminders**
   - Sent 24 hours after lessons with pending payment
   - Shows amount and student name

**Note:** Notifications require the `expo-notifications` package to be properly configured in your Expo app.

### 6. Data Export

#### Exporting Data

From the Settings screen:

1. Tap "📊 Εξαγωγή Δεδομένων (CSV)"
2. Select "Όλα τα Δεδομένα"
3. Data is exported as CSV files:
   - `students_YYYY-MM-DD.csv` - All students
   - `lessons_YYYY-MM-DD.csv` - All lessons for current year
   - `stats_YYYY-MM-DD.txt` - Payment statistics

**CSV Format:**

**Students CSV:**
```
Όνομα,Επώνυμο,Έτος Γέννησης,Γονέας,Τηλέφωνο,Email,Μέγεθος Βιολιού,Προεπ. Διάρκεια,Προεπ. Τιμή,Σημειώσεις
```

**Lessons CSV:**
```
Ημερομηνία,Ώρα,Μαθητής,Διάρκεια (λεπτά),Τιμή (€),Κατάσταση Πληρωμής,Σημειώσεις
```

### 7. Backup & Restore

#### Creating a Backup

1. Navigate to Settings
2. Tap "💾 Δημιουργία Αντιγράφου Ασφαλείας"
3. Confirm the backup creation
4. Save or share the generated JSON file

**Backup Contents:**
- All students
- All lessons (past year + next year)
- All recurring lesson rules
- Metadata about backup

**Backup File Format:**
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-25T...",
  "data": {
    "students": [...],
    "lessons": [...],
    "recurringLessons": [...]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "studentsCount": 10,
    "lessonsCount": 150,
    "recurringLessonsCount": 5
  }
}
```

#### Restoring from Backup

**Note:** Restore functionality is intentionally limited to prevent data loss. For restoration:
1. Use Supabase dashboard for database restoration
2. Or manually import backup data through SQL queries

### 8. Automated Lesson Generation

#### Manual Generation

From the Settings screen:

1. Tap "🔄 Δημιουργία Μαθημάτων (30 ημέρες)"
2. Confirm the generation
3. Lessons are created for the next 30 days based on all recurring rules

**What It Does:**
- Reads all active recurring lesson rules
- Generates lessons for each rule for the next 30 days
- Checks for duplicates (won't create if lesson already exists)
- Shows count of generated lessons

**Automatic Generation:**

Enable "Αυτόματη Δημιουργία Μαθημάτων" in Settings for future automatic generation capabilities.

### 9. Student Progress Tracking

#### Database Schema

A new `student_progress` table has been added to track student progress:

```sql
CREATE TABLE student_progress (
    progress_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES students(student_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    imera_kataxorisis TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    perigrafi TEXT NOT NULL,
    skill_level INTEGER CHECK (skill_level BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
    kommati_mousikis VARCHAR(255),
    simiwseis TEXT,
    created_by VARCHAR(100)
);
```

#### API Functions

**Available in `supabaseService.js`:**

```javascript
// Get progress for a student
const result = await getStudentProgress(studentId);

// Add progress entry
const result = await addStudentProgress({
  student_id: 1,
  perigrafi: "Learned new technique",
  skill_level: 4,
  kommati_mousikis: "Vivaldi - Spring",
  simiwseis: "Great improvement",
  created_by: "Teacher Name"
});

// Update progress entry
const result = await updateStudentProgress(progressId, updateData);

// Delete progress entry
const result = await deleteStudentProgress(progressId);
```

**Note:** UI for progress tracking can be added to the student detail screen in future updates.
